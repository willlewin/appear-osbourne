A 3D printable face shield targetting quick stackable prints for maximum throughput. Based on the shield by 3dverkstan (https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/)

The design was modified to:
* Bring the shield further away from the users face.
* Make the device stackable for 3D printing
* Work with a A4 european 4 hole punch
* Include a top window to prevent droplets from contacting the face through the top of the shield

Prints were tested using:
* Tiertime UP ABS filament
* An UP 300 3D printer
* 0.4mm nozzle
* 0.35mm layer height
* 13% infill
* No support

**Note that this is not an approved medical or protective device and has not been tested or certified as fit for any restricted use.**
